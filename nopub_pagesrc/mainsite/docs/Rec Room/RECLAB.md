# RECLAB

***This Project is currently on hold due to RRS-related issues.***

**RECLAB** aims to be a recreation of **BONELAB** in **Rec Room**. 

## Things to know
- Development has just started, so the room is **not released yet**.
- We have got maps from **BONELAB** working, but they are **currently too buggy for release**.
- We will eventually be experimenting with **BoneRecs**, which will be an SDK based on the **Marrow SDK** from **BONELAB**.
- This is a **MASSIVE** project, so it will take a very long time to be fully complete.
- We are currently having trouble with **Rec Room Studio** builds. so it may take **longer than expected**.
