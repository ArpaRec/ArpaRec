# Portal_02

A recreation of Portal 2 in Rec Room, with the end goal including an SDK for custom map creation.

## Things to know:
- The Portal Gun is made using our own in-house physics/interaction engine, called PortalRec.
- PortalRec is not available to the public yet, because it is not very optimised, and creating maps involves a lot of tweaking to get things just right for that map.
- PortalRec 2 is in development, which includes an updated Portal Gun, with many bug fixes and more features.

:::warning
Please do not bug the devs for a copy of PortalRec, because it is not ready for release. We will let you know when it is ready!
