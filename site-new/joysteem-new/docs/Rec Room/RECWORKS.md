# RECWORKS

**RECWORKS** aims to be a recreation of **BONEWORKS** and **BONELAB** in **Rec Room**. 

## Things to know
- Development has just started, so the room is **not released yet**.
- We have got maps from **BONEWORKS** working, but they are **currently too buggy for release**.
- We will eventually be experimenting with **BoneRecs**, which will be an SDK based on the **Marrow SDK** from **BONELAB**.
- It may involve numerous amounts of subrooms for each maps, because they are **MASSIVE**. To put it in perspective, to port the map **Breakroom** from **BONEWORKS**, we had to downscale the textures from **1024x1024** to **256x256**. We also had to delete a ton of background mesh, and it uploads, with **300KB** to spare.
- This is a **MASSIVE** project, so it will take a very long time to be fully complete.
